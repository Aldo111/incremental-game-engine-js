incremental-game-engine-js (v1.0)
==========================

A simple Javascript/jQuery framework to allow the quick creation, deployment, and expansion of incremental games.

[DEMO](http://aldo111.github.io/incremental-game-engine-js/ "v1.0")

Goal
====
The goal of this is to create a very simple-to-use javascript framework for other incremental-game enthusiasts! I've often seen many people online who would like to embark upon their own ventures but lack either the time or skills to get some of the boring stuff out of the way.

So this is the purpose of the engine: get the boring stuff out of the way and onto the fun stuff!


FILES
====

#### Essential:
1. js/incrementalObject.js -> The main file
2. js/jquery.js -> jQuery file used. 

#### Non-Essential [Only for DEMO]:
1. js/ParticleObject.js -> Just a simple particle script I made for the background stars. I was building the game engine on top of another project and so this is just a nice (visually appealing) artefact. Not required at all.
2. css/incremental_style.css -> The CSS of the demo
3. css/fonts/NewCircle/ -> The font I'm using for the demo page
4. index.html -> The Demo Page


NOTES
====
1. I will update this README with a quick how-to soon; my first priority is to get the current TODO list done before sharing it with others!
2. Although jQuery is used very rarely, it is not at all required and the few jQuery portions of the code that exist can (and in the final version, will) be replaced by vanilla JS.



TODO
====

1. Allow programmers to add multiple stats of different types.
2. Allow greater control and manipulation of items and item sets.
3. Continue making this awesome and easy to use!
