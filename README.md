incremental-game-engine-js (v0.0)
==========================

A simple javascript/JQuery framework to allow the quick creation, deployment, and expansion of incremental games.


Goal
====
The goal of this is to create a very simple-to-use javascript framework for other incremental-game enthusiasts! I've often seen many people online who would like to embark upon their own ventures but lack either the time or skills to get some of the boring stuff out of the way.

So this is the purpose of the engine: get the boring stuff out of the way and onto the fun stuff!

TODO
====

1. Allow programmers to add multiple stats of different types.
2. Allow greater control and manipulation of items and item sets.
3. Continue making this awesome and easy to use!
